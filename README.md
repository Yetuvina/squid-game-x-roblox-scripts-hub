## 🧩 Detailed Function Descriptions

**Core SquidAutoController()**
Unifies game round initiation and player management, checking for optimal game settings and readying each minigame event with a single call. It harnesses API intelligence to adapt based on real-time player input and environmental variables.

**DynamicLangSelector(language)**
Switches the entire UI and automated prompts to the required language. Supports RTL and LTR scripts, Unicode icons, and fallback logic when an unsupported language is requested.

**AIMoveStrategy(game_event, ai_level)**
Feeds your game events into either OpenAI or Claude for real-time, context-driven strategy. For example, bots in “Red Light, Green Light” adapt their movements as humans do, upping the fun.

**PlayerMonitorNotifier(playerID)**
Monitors player events: entry, exit, round performance. Instantly notifies you of critical changes or competitive highlights directly within the game’s chat or admin dashboard.

**SquidRewardEngine(event_winners)**
Automatically calculates and distributes event rewards, factoring in event type, difficulty, and winner stats.

**SeamlessAPIUpdater()**
Ensures that connections to OpenAI and Claude services remain stable and up-to-date, even if API changes occur, resulting in uninterrupted gameplay experience.
